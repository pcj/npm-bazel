This project provides a generator tool, `npm-bazel-gen.py`, to generate `WORKSPACE` rules and `BUILD` files for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules. It also provides Skylark rules in `build_tools/npm.bzl` to build `npm` modules in Bazel's sandbox.

# Stability: prototype

This is a public clone of code that we're using internally at [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/). The version we actually use seems to be working, but we cannot guarantee that this repository will be stable/maintained. (But hope springs eternal, and if people seem to like it, we could stabilize it further.)

# Getting Started

Generate the `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` files using the Python script, then build the example projects.

```
python npm-bazel-gen.py
bazel build foo
```

# Background

## Required knowledge

* What `npm install` kinda does, a little about how node_modules work
* What a Bazel Skylark rule does http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/index.html
    * This is a bit tougher to come by, but you can get pretty far by reading these three docs in order:
        * http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html
        * http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/rules.html
        * http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/cookbook.html
        * And then read them again, starting with "concepts"

## What does `npm install` do?

`npm install` with no arguments does two-and-a-half things.

1. "Install dependencies"
    1. "Download" dependencies declared in `package.json` into `./node_modules` (de-duping dependencies and resolving circular dependencies as needed)
    2. "Rebuild" those downloaded dependencies. (You can `npm rebuild` to re-run this.)
        * Compile native code: if any of those deps had native code in them, they need to be recompiled. There are no limitations on what this build step is allowed to do.
        * Symlink scripts: if any of the deps provided executable scripts to run in the "bin" section of package.json, ("gulp" is especially important,) then node will symlink them into `node_modules/.bin`

        For example, `node_modules/.bin/gulp` will be a symlink to `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`
2. "Prepublish" current project: if `package.json` declares a `scripts.prepublish` step, it'll run that. A common scripts.prepublish step is: "gulp prepublish". (npm automatically adds `node_modules/.bin` to the path when running this script.)

To generate a `.tgz` output file, we can run `npm pack`, which does two things:

<ol start="3">
<li>Prepublish: runs (re-runs) the "prepublish" step</li>
<li>Tar: It tars up everything in the current directory, except for anything explicitly ignored by `.npmignore`.</li>
</ol>


Some of these steps violate Bazel's sandbox.

* 1a "Download": Obviously, this uses the network.
* 1b "Rebuild": The rebuild scripts are, in principle, allowed to do anything, including access the network, and sometimes they do that. In particular, the way to generate bindings from node to native code is to run `node-gyp`, which tries to download header files on first launch and caches them in `~/.node-gyp`.
* 2 "Prepublish": This script may try to access the network. For example, lots of modules use [`nsp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsp) to query for known Node security vulnerabilities. (`nsp` has an offline mode, but it's "unofficial, unsupported.")

## How we implemented that in Bazel

1. Install phase: `build_tools/npm_installer.sh`
    1. Download:
        * `npm-bazel-gen.py` scans all package.json files, finding the full dependency tree (tree of trees? forest?) and declares all external dependencies as rules in the `WORKSPACE` file
        * `build_tools/install-npm-dependencies.py` is a script that simulates what `npm install` would have done, including de-duping dependencies and handling circular dependencies. (`npm` allows circular dependencies! ðŸ˜®) **BEWARE This script is currently imperfect! It doesn't do exactly what `npm` would have done.**
    2. Rebuild:
        * We run `npm rebuild` directly after we run `install_npm_dependencies`.
        * To avoid sandbox violations, we set `HOME=/tmp` and pre-install `/tmp/.node-gyp`
    3. We do _not_ run prepublish during this "install" phase, because we plan to run it during packaging.
    4. We then tar up the generated `node_modules` folder.
2. Pack phase: `build_tools/npm_packer.sh`
    1. Setup: We're not allowed to modify source files directly, so we setup by:
        * rsyncing source files to a work directory
        * untar the generated `node_modules` folder into the work directory
    2. We run `npm pack` which runs the prepublish script, if any, and generates the final output.

## `npm.bzl`

`npm.bzl`  defines two rules, `external_npm_module` and `internal_npm_module`. "external" means "third party," as opposed to "internal" modules being built by Bazel.

The `internal_npm_module` rule is responsible for running `npm_installer.sh` and then `npm_packer.sh` as `ctx.action`s.

The majority of `npm.bzl` is a bunch of code to marshall the correct list of inputs and outputs for the "install" phase and then the "pack" phase. Both types of rules return a `struct()` containing three fields:

* `internal` (boolean): `external_npm_module` sets this to false, internal_npm_module sets this to true
* `transitive_external_deps` (list<module>): the full set of external dependency modules for the current module (including indirect dependencies)
* `transitive_internal_deps` (list<module>): the full set of internal dependency modules for the current module (including indirect dependencies). `external_npm_module` returns an empty list for this.

In addition, internal modules return these two fields:

* `tarball` (file): The generated tarball file for this module
* `package_json` (file): The `package.json` file input (used by other rules to compute the dependency tree)

Skylark calls this system of a rule returning a `struct()` a "provider" in Skylark. http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/rules.html (Cmd-F for the "Providers" section)

Skylark's documentation on providers is pretty light, but all it means is: rules can return a `struct()` of data to _provide_ it to dependent rules.

The top of `npm.bzl` is taking the list of `deps` and the list of `dev_deps`, sorting them into internal and external dependencies, and assembling four lists:

* `transitive_internal_deps`
* `transitive_external_deps`
* `transitive_internal_dev_deps`
* `transitive_external_dev_deps`

It then creates an `internal_modules.json` file using the two "internal" lists, so `install_npm_dependencies.py` knows where to look for internal modules.

It then runs two `ctx.action` commands:

1. the "install" phase, which runs `build_tools/npm_installer.sh` to generate `foo_node_modules.tar.gz` with these inputs:
    1. All dependencies
    2. `package.json` files for all internal dependencies
    3. `internal_modules.json`
2. the "pack" phase, which runs `build_tools/npm_packer.sh` to generate `foo.tgz` with these inputs:
    1. foo_node_modules.tar.gz
    2. All of the source files in the current working directory


## Non-standard projects

In our project at Redfin, we have a bunch of projects that do weird/non-standard stuff, usually during the "pack" phase, but sometimes during the "install" phase.

The `internal_npm_module` rule has `install_tool` and `pack_tool` attributes, which default to `build_tools:npm_installer` and `build_tools:npm_packer` but you can override them to anything you want, including defining a `sh_binary` with arbitrary dependencies. (You have to hack in special cases to `npm-bazel-gen.py` to make it add those for you, when you want it.)

In addition, the default packer tool looks for a `./extra-bazel-script` file in the current directory, and if it finds one, it just runs whatever it sees there. In some cases, that's enough pluggability.

## Next steps

* Shouldn't I use the new remote repository rule thingy? I should learn more about how that works
* The generator script generates the `@node` WORKSPACE differently on OS X and Linux. How do we make a single target that DTRT on other platforms?
* Windows?!
